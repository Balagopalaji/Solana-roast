# Archived Documentation

This directory contains the original documentation files that were created during the initial development and analysis phase of SolanaRoast.lol. These files have been archived as part of our documentation reorganization.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files represent our initial approach to solving technical challenges we encountered. While they contain valuable insights, they have been superseded by our new, more structured documentation (in the parent directory).

## Contents
- `FINAL_RECOMMENDATION.md` - Original recommendations before synthesis
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Initial implementation approach
- `ORIGINAL_DEV_PLAN.md` - First development plan
- `PATH_FORWARD.md` - Initial recovery strategy
- `SYNTHESIS_AND_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Original synthesis of recommendations

## Historical Value
These documents provide valuable context about:
1. Our decision-making process
2. Technical challenges encountered
3. Evolution of our architectural thinking
4. Lessons learned about complexity management
